But the history of thought shows us that many people were totally committed to absurd beliefs. If the strengths of beliefs were a hallmark of knowledge, we should have to rank some tales about demons, angels, devils, and of heaven and hell as knowledge. Scientists, on the other hand, are very sceptical even of their best theories. Newton's is the most powerful theory science has yet produced, but Newton himself never believed that bodies attract each other at a distance. So no degree of commitment to beliefs makes them knowledge. Indeed, the hallmark of scientific behaviour is a certain scepticism even towards one's most cherished theories. Blind commitment to a theory is not an intellectual virtue: it is an intellectual crime.", "\nThus a statement may be pseudoscientific even if it is eminently 'plausible' and everybody believes in it, and it may be scientifically valuable even if it is unbelievable and nobody believes in it. A theory may even be of supreme scientific value even if no one understands it, let alone believes in it.", "The boundary between science and pseudoscience is disputed and difficult to determine analytically, even after more than a century of study by philosophers of science and ", ", and despite some basic agreements on the fundamentals of the scientific method.", " The concept of pseudoscience rests on an understanding that the scientific method has been misrepresented or misapplied with respect to a given theory, but many philosophers of science maintain that different kinds of methods are held as appropriate across different fields and different eras of human history. According to Lakatos, the typical descriptive unit of great scientific achievements is not an isolated hypothesis but \"a powerful problem-solving machinery, which, with the help of sophisticated mathematical techniques, digests anomalies and even turns them into positive evidence\".", "\n", "To Popper, pseudoscience uses induction to generate theories, and only performs experiments to seek to verify them. To Popper, falsifiability is what determines the scientific status of a theory. Taking a historical approach, Kuhn observed that scientists did not follow Popper's rule, and might ignore falsifying data, unless overwhelming. To Kuhn, puzzle-solving within a paradigm is science. Lakatos attempted to resolve this debate, by suggesting history shows that science occurs in research programmes, competing according to how progressive they are. The leading idea of a programme could evolve, driven by its heuristic to make predictions that can be supported by evidence. Feyerabend claimed that Lakatos was selective in his examples, and the whole history of science shows there is no universal rule of scientific method, and imposing one on the scientific community impedes progress.", " Laudan maintained that the demarcation between science and non-science was a pseudo-problem, preferring to focus on the more general distinction between reliable and unreliable knowledge.", "\n", "[Feyerabend] regards Lakatos's view as being closet anarchism disguised as methodological rationalism. Feyerabend's claim was not that standard methodological rules should never be obeyed, but rather that sometimes progress is made by abandoning them. In the absence of a generally accepted rule, there is a need for alternative methods of persuasion. According to Feyerabend, Galileo employed stylistic and rhetorical techniques to convince his reader, while he also wrote in Italian rather than Latin and directed his arguments to those already temperamentally inclined to accept them.", "The demarcation problem between science and pseudoscience brings up debate in the realms of science, ", " and ", ".

Regarding parenting, authoritative parents who are warm and high in behavioral control but low in psychological control are more likely to be seen as having legitimate authority over the child, and will believe themselves that they have a duty to obey them and internalize their values. While the study of children in modern capitalist societies does look at the psychological aspects of children's understanding of legitimate authority at the level of symbolic interaction it is also true that is an extrapolated assumption based on one interpretation of a broad Comparative Historical Sociological (CHS) analysis of legitimate authority in multiple societies over a long duration, not the micro-social psychological study of children per se.

Renan was also known for being a strong critic of ", ", with its antisemitic undertones.", " His notions of race and ethnicity were completely at odds with the European antisemitism of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n", "Renan wrote the following about the long history of ", ":\n", "When all nations and all ages have persecuted you, there must be some motive behind it all. The Jew, up to our own time, insinuated himself everywhere, claiming the protection of the common law; but, in reality, remaining outside the common law. He retained his own status; he wished to have the same guarantees as everyone else, and, over and above that, his own exceptions and special laws. He desired the advantages of the nations without being a nation, without helping to bear the burdens of the nations. No people has ever been able to tolerate this. The nations are military creations founded and maintained by the sword; they are the work of peasants and soldiers; towards establishing them the Jews have contributed nothing. Herein is the great fallacy inspired in Israelite pretensions. The tolerated alien can be useful to a country, but only on condition that the country does not allow itself to be invaded by him. It is not fair to claim family rights in a house which one has not built, like those birds which come and take up their quarters in a nest which does not belong to them, or like the crustaceans which steal the shell of another species.", "However, during the 1880s, Renan shifted away from these views. In a lecture on \"Judaism as a Race and as a Religion\", he stated:\n", "When, in 1791, the National Assembly decreed the emancipation of the Jews, it concerned itself very little with race. It considered that men ought to be judged, not by the blood that runs in their veins, but by their moral and intellectual value. It is the glory of France to take these questions by their human side. The work of the nineteenth century is to tear down every ghetto, and I have no praise for those who seek to rebuild them. The Israelite race has in the past rendered the greatest services to the world. Blended with the different nations, in harmony with the diverse national unities of Europe, it will continue to do in the future what it has done in the past. By its collaboration with all the liberal forces of Europe, it will contribute eminently to the social progress of humanity.", "\nIn the aforementioned 1882 conference on ", ", Renan had spoken out against the theories that were based on race: ", "Both the principle of nations is right and legitimate, as that of the primordial right of races is wrong and full of dangers for true progress … The truth is that pure race does not exist and that to base politics on ethnographic analysis means to base it on a chimera.", "And in 1883, in a lecture called \"The Original Identity and Gradual Separation of Judaism and Christianity\":\n", "Judaism, which has served so well in the past, will still serve in the future. It will serve the true cause of liberalism, of the modern spirit. Every Jew is a liberal ... The enemies of Judaism, however, if you only look at them more closely, you will see that they are the enemies of the modern spirit in general.", "Other comments on race, have also proven controversial, especially his belief that political policy should take into account supposed racial differences:\n", "Nature has made a race of workers, the Chinese race, who have wonderful manual dexterity and almost no sense of honor... A race of tillers of the soil, the Negro; treat him with kindness and humanity, and all will be as it should; a race of masters and soldiers, the European race. Reduce this noble race to working in the ", " like Negroes and Chinese, and they rebel... But the life at which our workers rebel would make a Chinese or a ", " happy, as they are not military creatures in the least. Let each one do what he is made for, and all will be well.", "This passage, among others, was cited by ", " in his ", ", as evidence of the alleged hypocrisy of Western humanism and its \"sordidly racist\" conception of the rights of man.", "\n", "During the arising of racism theories around Europe and specifically in ", ", Renan had an important influence on the matter. He was a defender of people's ", " concept,", " but on the other hand was in fact convinced of a \"racial hierarchy of peoples\" that he said was \"established\".", " Discursively, he subordinated the principle of self-determination of peoples to a racial hierarchy,", " i.e. he supported the colonialist expansion and the racist view of the Third Republic because he believed the French to be hierarchically superior (in a racial matter) to the African nations.", " This subtle racism, called by ", " \"Republican racism\",", " was common in France during the Third Republic and was also a well-known defensing discourse in politics. Supporters of colonialism used the concept of cultural superiority, and described themselves as \"protectors of civilization\" to justify their colonial actions and territorial expansion.

Facing Angelique Kerber, she won the first set, but was ultimately defeated by the German player. Hsieh also had a successful doubles tournament, reaching the semifinals with Peng Shuai, her best performance in a slam since they won the French Open. She returned to inside the top 75 of the singles rankings and the top 30 of the doubles rankings after the Australian Open.\n", "After the Australian Open, Hsieh had a relatively quiet rest of the early hardcourt season singles-wise. After losing the qualifying rounds in Doha and Dubai, and a second-round loss at the Oracle Challenge, Hsieh qualified into the main draw at Indian Wells and progressed to the second round. Her best result came at the Miami Open where she advanced to the third round for the first time, losing to Karolína Plíšková.

Since there was still a lack of functioning government in Fiji, these planters were often able to get the land in violent or fraudulent ways such as exchanging weapons or alcohol with Fijians who may or may not have been the true owners. Although this made for cheap land acquisition, competing land claims between the planters became problematic with no unified government to resolve the disputes.

Once again, conflict with the Kai Colo in the interior of Viti Levu ensued. In 1871, the killing of two settlers near the ", " in the northwest of the island prompted a large ", " of white farmers, imported slave labourers, and coastal Fijians to be organised. This group of around 400 armed vigilantes, including veterans of the U.S. Civil War, had a battle with the Kai Colo near the village of Cubu, in which both sides had to withdraw.

The solution was to form an army. Robert S. Swanston, the minister for Native Affairs in the Kingdom, organised the training and arming of suitable Fijian volunteers and prisoners to become soldiers in what was variably called the King's Troops or the Native Regiment. In a similar system to the ", " that was present in the colonies of Australia, two white settlers, James Harding and W. Fitzgerald, were appointed as the head officers of this paramilitary brigade.", " The formation of this force did not sit well with many of the white plantation owners as they did not trust an army of Fijians to protect their interests.\n", "The situation intensified further in early 1873 when the Burns family was killed by a Kai Colo raid in the Ba River area. The Cakobau government deployed 50 King's Troopers to the region under the command of Major Fitzgerald to restore order. The local whites refused their posting, and deployment of another 50 troops under Captain Harding was sent to emphasise the government's authority. To prove the worth of the Native Regiment, this augmented force went into the interior and massacred about 170 Kai Colo people at Na Korowaiwai. Upon returning to the coast, the force was met by the white settlers who still saw the government troops as a threat. A skirmish between the government's troops and the white settlers' brigade was only prevented by the intervention of Captain William Cox Chapman of ", ", who detained the settlers' leaders, forcing the group to disband.

Major Fitzgerald and Major H.C. Thurston (the brother of John Bates Thurston) led a two pronged attack throughout the region. The combined forces of the different clans of the Kai Colo made a stand at the village of Na Culi. The Kai Colo were defeated with dynamite and fire being used to flush them out from their defensive positions amongst the mountain caves. Many Kai Colo were killed, and one of the main leaders of the hill clans, Ratu Dradra, was forced to surrender with around 2,000 men, women and children being taken prisoner and sent to the coast.", " In the months after this defeat, the only main resistance was from the clans around the village of Nibutautau. Major Thurston crushed this resistance in the two months following the battle at Na Culi. Villages were burnt, Kai Colo were killed, and a further large number of prisoners were taken.", " About 1,000 of the prisoners (men, women and children) were sent to Levuka where some were hanged and the rest were sold into ", " and forced to work on various plantations throughout the islands.", "\n", "The ", " era began in Fiji in 1865 when the first ", " and ", " labourers were transported there to work on cotton plantations.

Melanesian labourers were to be recruited for a term of three years, paid three pounds per year, issued basic clothing, and given access to the company store for supplies. Most Melanesians were recruited by deceit, usually being enticed aboard ships with gifts, and then locked up. In 1875, the chief medical officer in Fiji, Sir ", ", listed a mortality rate of 540 out of every 1,000 labourers. After the expiry of the three-year contract, the government required captains to transport the labourers back to their villages, but most ship captains dropped them off at the first island they sighted off the Fiji waters. The British sent warships to enforce the law (", " (", " c. 19)), but only a small proportion of the culprits were prosecuted.\n", "A notorious incident of the blackbirding trade was the 1871 voyage of the brig ", ", organised by Dr. James Patrick Murray", " to recruit labourers to work in the plantations of Fiji. Murray had his men reverse their collars and carry black books, to appear as church missionaries. When islanders were enticed to a religious service, Murray and his men would produce guns and force the islanders onto boats. During the voyage Murray shot about 60 islanders. He was never brought to trial for his actions, as he was given immunity in return for giving evidence against his crew members.", " The captain of the ", ", Joseph Armstrong, was later sentenced to death.", "\n", "In addition to the blackbirded labour from other Pacific islands, thousands of people indigenous to the Fijian archipelago were sold into slavery on the plantations. As the white settler backed Cakobau government, and later the British colonial government, subjugated areas in Fiji under its power, the resultant prisoners of war were regularly sold at auction to the planters. This provided a source of revenue for the government and also dispersed the rebels to different, often isolated islands where the plantations were located. The land that was occupied by these people before they became slaves was then also sold for additional revenue. An example of this is the Lovoni people of Ovalau, who after being defeated in a war with the Cakobau government in 1871, were rounded up and sold to the settlers at £6 per head. Two thousand Lovoni men, women and children were sold, and their period of slavery lasted five years.", " Likewise, after the Kai Colo wars in 1873, thousands of people from the hill tribes of Viti Levu were sent to Levuka and sold into slavery.", " Warnings from the Royal Navy stationed in the area that buying these people was illegal were largely given without enforcement, and the British consul in Fiji, Edward Bernard Marsh, regularly turned a blind eye to this type of labour trade.", "\n", "Despite achieving military victories over the Kai Colo, the Cakobau government was faced with problems of legitimacy and economic viability. Indigenous Fijians and white settlers refused to pay taxes, and the cotton price had collapsed. With these major issues in mind, John Bates Thurston approached the British government, at Cakobau's request, with another offer to cede the islands.

In 1875–76 the resulting epidemic of measles killed over 40,000 Fijians,", " about one-third of the Fijian population. Some Fijians allege that this failure of quarantine was a deliberate action to introduce the disease into the country.

Gordon was immediately faced with an insurgency of the Qalimari and Kai Colo people. In early 1875, colonial administrator ", " had met with thousands of highland clans at Navuso to formalise their subjugation to British rule and Christianity. Layard and his delegation managed to spread the measles epidemic to the highlanders, causing mass deaths in this population. As a result, anger at the British colonists flared throughout the region, and a widespread uprising quickly took hold. Villages along the Sigatoka River and in the highlands above this area refused British control, and Gordon was tasked with quashing this rebellion.", "\n", "In what Gordon termed the \"Little War\", the suppression of this uprising took the form of two co-ordinated military campaigns in the western half of Viti Levu. The first was conducted by Gordon's second cousin, Arthur John Lewis Gordon, against the Qalimari insurgents along the Sigatoka River. The second campaign was led by ", " against the Kai Colo in the mountains to the north of the river.

The two groups of rebels were kept isolated from each other by a force led by Walter Carew and ", " who were stationed at Nasaucoko. Carew also ensured the rebellion did not spread east by securing the loyalty of the Wainimala people of the eastern highlands.

Governor Gordon was present, but chose to leave the judicial responsibility to his relative, Arthur John Lewis Gordon. Four were hanged and ten, including Mudu, were shot with one prisoner managing to escape. By the end of proceedings the governor noted that \"my feet were literally stained with the blood that I had shed\".", "\n", "The northern campaign against the Kai Colo in the highlands was similar but involved removing the rebels from large, well protected caves in the region. Knollys managed to clear the caves \"after some considerable time and large expenditure of ammunition\". The occupants of these caves included whole communities, and as a result many men, women and children were either killed or wounded in these operations. The rest were taken prisoner and sent to the towns on the northern coast. The chief medical officer in British Fiji, William MacGregor, also took part both in killing Kai Colo and tending to their wounded. After the caves were taken, the Kai Colo surrendered and their leader, Bisiki, was captured. Various trials were held, mostly at Nasaucoko under Le Hunte, and 32 men were either hanged or shot including Bisiki, who was killed trying to escape.", "\n", "By the end of October 1876, the \"Little War\" was over, and Gordon had succeeded in vanquishing the rebels in the interior of Viti Levu. Remaining insurgents were sent into exile with hard labour for up to 10 years. Some non-combatants were allowed to return to rebuild their villages, but many areas in the highlands were ordered by Gordon to remain depopulated and in ruins. Gordon also constructed a military fortress, Fort Canarvon, at the headwaters of the Sigatoka River where a large contingent of soldiers were based to maintain British control. He renamed the Native Regiment, the Armed Native Constabulary to lessen its appearance of being a military force.", "\n", "To further consolidate social control throughout the colony, Governor Gordon introduced a system of appointed chiefs and village constables in the various districts to both enact his orders and report any disobedience from the populace.

This body remained in existence until being suspended by the military-backed interim government in 2007 and only abolished in 2012.\nGordon also extinguished the ability of Fijians to own, buy or sell land as individuals, the control being transferred to colonial authorities.", "\n", "Gordon decided in 1878 to import indentured labourers from India to work on the sugarcane fields that had taken the place of the cotton plantations. The 463 Indians arrived on 14 May 1879 – the first of some 61,000 that were to come before the scheme ended in 1916. The plan involved bringing the Indian workers to Fiji on a five-year contract, after which they could return to India at their own expense; if they chose to renew their contract for a second five-year term, they would be given the option of returning to India at the government's expense, or remaining in Fiji. The great majority chose to stay. The Queensland Act, which regulated indentured labour in Queensland, was made law in Fiji also.\n", "Between 1879 and 1916, tens of thousands of Indians moved to Fiji to work as indentured labourers, especially on sugarcane plantations. Given the steady influx of ships carrying indentured Indians to Fiji up until 1916, repatriated Indians generally boarded these same ships on their return voyage. The total number of repatriates under the Fiji indenture system is recorded as 39,261, while the number of arrivals is said to have been 60,553. Because the return figure includes children born in Fiji, many of the indentured Indians never returned to India.\n", "With almost all aspects of indigenous Fijian social life being controlled by the British colonial authorities, a number of charismatic individuals preaching dissent and return to pre-colonial culture were able to forge a following amongst the disenfranchised. These movements were called Tuka, which roughly translates as \"those who stand up\". The first Tuka movement was led by Ndoongumoy, better known as Navosavakandua, which means \"he who speaks only once\". He told his followers that if they returned to traditional ways and worshipped traditional deities such as Degei and Rokola, their current condition would be transformed, with the whites and their puppet Fijian chiefs being subservient to them. Navosavakandua was previously exiled from the Viti Levu highlands in 1878 for disturbing the peace, and the British quickly arrested him and his followers after this open display of rebellion. He was again exiled, this time to ", " where he died soon after his 10-year sentence ended.", "\n", "Other Tuka organisations, however, soon appeared.

The British and their proxy Council of Chiefs were not able to prevent the Viti Kabani's rise, and again the colonists were forced to send in the Armed Native Constabulary. Apolosi and his followers were arrested in 1915, and the company collapsed in 1917. Over the next 30 years, Apolosi was re-arrested, jailed and exiled, with the British viewing him as a threat right up to his death in 1946.", "\n", "Fiji was only peripherally involved in World War I.

In his 1993 works, Plantinga argued that according to classical foundationalism most of us are irrational for having many beliefs we cannot justify, but which foundationalism does not accept as properly basic.

This point is answered by many theistic arguments which purport to provide sufficient propositional and physical evidence to warrant that belief, apart from reformed epistemology.\n", "According to Reformed epistemology, belief in God can be rational and justified even without arguments or evidence for the existence of God.

Plantinga asserts that the design plan does not require a designer: \"it is perhaps possible that  evolution (undirected by God or anyone else) has somehow furnished us with our design plans\",", " but the paradigm case of a design plan is like a technological product designed by a human being (like a radio or a wheel). Ultimately, Plantinga argues that epistemological ", " – i.e. ", " that holds that warrant is dependent on natural faculties – is best supported by supernaturalist metaphysics – in this case the belief in a ", " or in some designer who has laid out a design plan that includes cognitive faculties conducive to attaining knowledge.", "\n", "According to Plantinga, a belief, B, is warranted if:\n", "\n(1) the cognitive faculties involved in the production of B are functioning properly...; (2) your cognitive environment is sufficiently similar to the one for which your cognitive faculties are designed; (3) ... the design plan governing the production of the belief in question involves, as purpose or function, the production of true beliefs...; and (4) the design plan is a good one: that is, there is a high statistical or objective probability that a belief produced in accordance with the relevant segment of the design plan in that sort of environment is true.", "Plantinga seeks to defend this view of proper function against alternative views of proper function proposed by other philosophers which he groups together as \"naturalistic\", including the \"functional generalization\" view of ", ", the evolutionary/etiological account provided by ", ", and a dispositional view held by ", " and Robert Pargetter.", " Plantinga also discusses his ", " in the later chapters of ", ".", "\n", "In 2000 Plantinga's third volume, ", ", was published. In this volume, Plantinga's warrant theory is the basis for his theological end: providing a philosophical basis for Christian belief, an argument for why Christian theistic belief can enjoy warrant. In the book, he develops two models for such beliefs, the \"A/C\" (", "/", ") model, and the \"Extended A/C\" model. The former attempts to show that a belief in God can be justified, warranted and rational, while the Extended model tries to show that core Christian theological beliefs, including the ", ", the ", ", the resurrection of ", ", the ", ", salvation, etc.", " can be warranted. Under this model, Christians are warranted in their beliefs because of the work of the ", " in bringing those beliefs about in the believer.\n", "James Beilby has argued that the purpose of Plantinga's ", " trilogy, and specifically of his ", ", is firstly to make a form of argument against religion impossible—namely, the argument that whether or not Christianity is true, it is irrational—so \"the skeptic would have to shoulder the formidable task of demonstrating the falsity of Christian belief\"", "\nrather than simply dismiss it as irrational. In addition, Plantinga is attempting to provide a philosophical explanation of how Christians should think about their own Christian belief.\n", "In 2016, Plantinga published ", ", which is intended as a shortened version of ", ".

If belief in God can be properly basic, why cannot just any belief be properly basic? Could we not say the same for any bizarre aberration we can think of? What about voodoo or astrology? What about the belief that the Great Pumpkin returns every Halloween? Could I properly take that as basic? Suppose I believe that if I flap my arms with sufficient vigor, I can take off and fly about the room; could I defend myself against the charge of irrationality by claiming this belief is basic? If we say that belief in God is properly basic, will we not be committed to holding that just anything, or nearly anything, can properly be taken as basic, thus throwing wide the gates to irrationalism and superstition? (p. 74)", "Plantinga's answer to this line of thinking is that the objection simply assumes that the criteria for \"proper basicality\" propounded by ", " (self-evidence, incorrigibility, and sense-perception) are the only possible criteria for properly basic beliefs. It is as if the Great Pumpkin objector feels that if properly basic beliefs cannot be arrived at by way of one of these criteria, then it follows that just 'any' belief could then be properly basic, precisely because there are no other criteria. But Plantinga says it simply doesn't follow from the rejection of classical foundationalist criteria that all possibility for criteria has been exhausted and this is exactly what the Great Pumpkin objection assumes.", "\n", "Plantinga takes his counter-argument further, asking how the Great Pumpkin objector \"knows\" that such criteria are the only criteria. The objector certainly seems to hold it as 'basic' that the classical foundationalist criteria are all that is available. Yet, such a claim is neither self-evident, incorrigible, nor evident to the senses. This rebuts the Great Pumpkin objection by demonstrating the classical foundationalist position to be internally incoherent, propounding an epistemic position which it itself does not follow.", "\n", "Other common criticisms of Plantinga's Reformed epistemology are that belief in God – like other sorts of widely debated and high-stakes beliefs – is \"evidence-essential\" rather than properly basic;", " that plausible naturalistic explanations can be given for humans' supposedly \"natural\" knowledge of God;", " and that it is arbitrary and arrogant for Christians to claim that their faith-beliefs are warranted and true (because vouched for by the Holy Spirit) while denying the validity of non-Christians' religious experiences.", "\n"]},

From the axioms that a property can only be positive if not-having-it is not positive, and that properties implied by a positive property must all also be themselves positive, it concludes that (since positive properties ", ") for any positive property, there is possibly a being that instantiates it. It defines God as the being instantiating all positive properties. After defining what it means for a property to be \"the essence\" of something (the one property that necessarily implies all its other properties), it concludes that God's instantiation of all positive properties must be the essence of God. After defining a property of \"necessary existence\" and taking it as an axiom that it is positive, the argument concludes that, since God must have this property, God must exist necessarily.\n", "Gödel left a fourteen-point outline of his philosophical beliefs in his papers.", " Points relevant to the ontological proof include:\n", "The first version of the ontological proof in Gödel's papers is dated \"around 1941\". Gödel is not known to have told anyone about his work on the proof until 1970, when he thought he was dying.

If a positive property ", " implies a property ", " in each possible world, then ", " is positive, too (axiom 1).", " Gödel then argues that each positive property is \"possibly exemplified\", i.e. applies at least to some object in some world (theorem 1).

Now, ", " is said to ", " if, for every essence ", " of ", ", there is an element ", " with property ", " in every possible world (definition 3). Axiom 5 requires necessary existence to be a positive property.\n", "Hence, it must follow from Godlikeness. Moreover, Godlikeness is an essence of God, since it entails all positive properties, and any non-positive property is the negation of some positive property, so God cannot have any non-positive properties. Since necessary existence is also a positive property (axiom 5), it must be a property of every Godlike object, as every Godlike object has all the positive properties (definition 1). Since any Godlike object is necessarily existent, it follows that any Godlike object in one world is a Godlike object in all worlds, by the definition of necessary existence. Given the existence of a Godlike object in one world, proven above, we may conclude that there is a Godlike object in every possible world, as required (theorem 4). Besides axiom 1-5 and definition 1–3, a few other axioms from modal logic", " were tacitly used in the proof.\n", "From these hypotheses, it is also possible to prove that there is only one God in each world by Leibniz's law, the ", ": two or more objects are identical (the same) if they have all their properties in common, and so, there would only be one object in each world that possesses property G.

It is particularly applicable to Gödel's proof – because it rests on five axioms, some of which are considered questionable. A proof does not necessitate that the conclusion be correct, but rather that by accepting the axioms, the conclusion follows logically.\n", "Many philosophers have called the axioms into question. The first layer of criticism is simply that there are no arguments presented that give reasons why the axioms are true. A second layer is that these particular axioms lead to unwelcome conclusions.

Cárdenas aimed to undermine the military's potential to dominate politics by making it a sector of the official party.

The union demanded 26 million pesos, the companies offered 12 million. Giving more force to Mexican workers' demands, Cárdenas set up the National Oil Administration and the government's Council of Conciliation and Arbitration took jurisdiction over the wage dispute. The Council supported the workers' demands, which the companies refused to pay. To put even more force into the government's position, it cancelled oil concessions dating to the Porfirato. This move was unprecedented in the history of foreign oil in Mexico. Management and high-skilled workers were all foreigners, so the companies thought that nationalization would be a rash move for Mexico. The companies appealed the government's decision to force companies to pay their wages to the Mexican Supreme Court, which ruled against them on 1 March 1938. Cárdenas was ready to act.

Lakatos attempted to resolve this debate, by suggesting history shows that science occurs in research programmes, competing according to how progressive they are. The leading idea of a programme could evolve, driven by its heuristic to make predictions that can be supported by evidence.

As Dusek (2006) notes, \"culture and society cannot affect the direction of technology…[and] as technology develops and changes, the institutions in the rest of society change, as does the art and religion of a society.\"", " Thus, technological determinism dictates that technological advances and social relations are inevitably tied, with the change of either affecting the other by consequence of normalization.", "\n", "This stance however ignores the social and cultural circumstances in which the technology was developed. Sociologist Claude Fischer (1992) characterized the most prominent forms of technological determinism as \"billiard ball\" approaches, in which technology is seen as an external force introduced into a social situation, producing a series of ricochet effects.", "\n", "Rather than acknowledging that a society or culture interacts with and even shapes the technologies that are used, a technological determinist view holds that \"the uses made of technology are largely determined by the structure of the technology itself, that is, that its functions follow from its form\" (", ").  However, this is not the sole view of TD following Smith and Marx's (1998)", " notion of \"hard\" determinism, which states that once a technology is introduced into a culture what follows is the inevitable development of that technology. In this view, the role of \"agency (the power to affect change) is imputed on the technology itself, or some of its intrinsic attributes; thus the invention of technology leads to a situation of inescapable necessity.\"\n", "The other view follows what Smith and Marx (1998)", " dictate as \"soft\" determinism, where the development of technology is also dependent on social context, affecting how it is adopted into a culture, \"and, if the technology is adopted, the social context will have important effects on how the technology is used and thus on its ultimate impact\".", "\n", "For example, we could examine the spread of mass-produced knowledge through the role of the printing press in the Protestant Reformation. Because of the urgency from the protestant side to get the reform off the ground before the church could react, \"early Lutheran leaders, led by Luther himself, wrote thousands of anti-papal pamphlets in the Reformation's first decades and these works spread rapidly through reprinting in various print shops throughout central Europe\".", " As such the urgency of the socio-political context to utilize such technology in the beginning of its invention caused its fast adoption and normalization into European culture. We could view its uses in its popularization – for political propaganda purposes – in line with the continued traditions of newspapers in modern times, as well as newly adopted uses for other printed text, adapting to change in a social context such as an emphasis on leisurely activities such as reading.  This follows the soft deterministic view because the technological invention – the printing press – was quickly adopted because of the socio-political context, and because of its fast integration into society, has impacted and continues to impact how society operates.\n", "In examining ", ", “hard determinism” can be contrasted with “soft determinism”. A ", " says that it is possible for ", " and determinism to exist in the world together, while an ", " would say that they cannot and there must be one or the other. Those who support ", " can be further divided.\n", "“Hard determinists” would view technology as developing independent from social concerns. They would say that technology creates a set of powerful forces acting to regulate our social activity and its meaning. According to this view of determinism we organize ourselves to meet the needs of technology, and the outcome of this organization is beyond our control or we do not have the freedom to make a choice regarding the outcome (autonomous technology). The 20th century French philosopher and social theorist ", " could be said to be a hard determinist and proponent of autonomous technique (technology). In his 1954 work ", ", Ellul essentially posits that technology, by virtue of its power through efficiency, determines which social aspects are best suited for its own development through a process of natural selection. A social system's values, morals, philosophy etc. that are most conducive to the advancement of technology allow that social system to enhance its power and spread at the expense of those social systems whose values, morals, philosophy etc. are less promoting of technology. While geography, climate, and other \"natural\" factors largely determined the parameters of social conditions for most of human history, technology has recently become the dominant objective factor (largely due to forces unleashed by the industrial revolution) and it has been the principal objective and determining factor.\n", "“Soft determinism”, as the name suggests, is a more passive view of the way technology interacts with socio-political situations. Soft determinists still subscribe to the fact that technology is the guiding force in our evolution but would maintain that we have a ", " to make decisions regarding the outcomes of a situation. This is not to say that free will exists, but that the possibility for us to ", " and see what the outcome exists. A slightly different variant of soft determinism is the 1922 technology-driven theory of social change proposed by ", ", in which society must adjust to the consequences of major inventions, but often does so only after a period of ", ".", "\n", " about technological determinism emerged alongside increased ", " about techno-science in the mid-20th century, in particular around the use of ", " in the production of ", ", ", " during ", ", and the problems of economic development in the ", ". As a direct consequence, desire for greater control of the course of development of technology gave rise to disenchantment with the model of technological determinism in academia.\n", "Modern theorists of technology and society no longer consider technological determinism to be a very accurate view of the way in which we interact with technology, even though determinist assumptions and language fairly saturate the writings of many boosters of technology, the business pages of many popular magazines, and much reporting on technology ", ". Instead, research in ", ", ", " and related fields have emphasized more nuanced views that resist easy causal formulations. They emphasize that \"The relationship between technology and society cannot be reduced to a simplistic cause-and-effect formula. It is, rather, an 'intertwining'\", whereby technology does not determine but \"operates, and are operated upon in a complex social field\" (Murphie and Potts).\n", "T. Snyder approached the aspect of technological determinism in his concept: 'politics of inevitability'.", " A concept utilized by politicians in which society is promised the idea that the future will be only more of the present, this concept removes responsibility. This could be applied to free markets, the development of nation states and technological progress.\n", "In his article \"Subversive Rationalization: Technology, Power and Democracy with Technology,\" ", " argues that technological determinism is not a very well founded concept by illustrating that two of the founding theses of determinism are easily questionable and in doing so calls for what he calls ", " (", " 210–212).\n", "Prominent opposition to technologically determinist thinking has emerged within work on the ", " (SCOT). SCOT research, such as that of Mackenzie and Wajcman (1997) argues that the path of innovation and its social consequences are strongly, if not entirely shaped by society itself through the influence of culture, politics, economic arrangements, regulatory mechanisms and the like. In its strongest form, verging on ", ", \"What matters is not the technology itself, but the social or economic system in which it is embedded\" (", ").\n", "In his influential but contested (see Woolgar and Cooper, 1999) article \"Do Artifacts Have Politics?\", ", " illustrates not a form of determinism but the various sources of the politics of technologies. Those politics can stem from the intentions of the designer and the culture of the society in which a technology emerges or can stem from the technology itself, a \"practical necessity\" for it to function. For instance, New York City urban planner ", " is purported to have built Long Island's parkway tunnels too low for buses to pass in order to keep minorities away from the island's beaches, an example of externally inscribed politics. On the other hand, an authoritarian command-and-control structure is a practical necessity of a nuclear power plant if radioactive waste is not to fall into the wrong hands. As such, Winner neither succumbs to technological determinism nor social determinism. The source of a technology's politics is determined only by carefully examining its features and history.\n", "Although \"The deterministic model of technology is widely propagated in society\" (Sarah Miller), it has also been widely questioned by scholars. ", " explains that, \"When technology was perceived as being outside society, it made sense to talk about technology as neutral\". Yet, this idea fails to take into account that culture is not fixed and society is dynamic. When \"Technology is implicated in social processes, there is nothing neutral about society\" (", "). This confirms one of the major problems with \"technological determinism and the resulting denial of human responsibility for change. There is a loss of human involvement that shape technology and society\" (Sarah Miller).\n", "Another conflicting idea is that of ", ", a term coined by Winner in his essay \"Technology as Forms of Life\". Winner wonders whether or not we are simply ", " through our existence with little concern or knowledge as to how we truly interact with technology. In this view, it is still possible for us to wake up and once again take control of the direction in which we are traveling (Winner 104). However, it requires society to adopt ", "'s claim that, \"users don't just passively consume technology, but actively transform it\".", "\n", "In opposition to technological determinism are those who subscribe to the belief of ", " and ", ". Social determinists believe that social circumstances alone select which technologies are adopted, with the result that no technology can be considered \"inevitable\" solely on its own merits. Technology and culture are not neutral and when knowledge comes into the equation, technology becomes implicated in social processes. The knowledge of how to create, enhance, and use technology is socially bound knowledge. Postmodernists take another view, suggesting that what is right or wrong is dependent on circumstance. They believe technological change can have implications on the past, present and future.", " While they believe technological change is influenced by changes in government policy, society and culture, they consider the notion of change to be a paradox, since change is constant.\n", "Media and cultural studies theorist ", ", in response to technological determinism, developed a model for the emergence of new technologies which is centered on the ", ". In two of his books – ", " (1997) and ", " (1998) – Winston applied this model to show how technologies evolve over time, and how their 'invention' is mediated and controlled by society and societal factors which suppress the radical potential of a given technology.\n", "Some interpret ", " as advocating technological determinism, with such statements as \"The Handmill gives you society with the feudal lord: the ", ", society with the industrial capitalist\" (", " 1847), but others argue that Marx was not a determinist.", "\n", "Technological determinist ", " reviews the societal transition from an oral culture to a written culture in his work ", " (1982). He asserts that this particular development is attributable to the use of new technologies of literacy (particularly print and writing,) to communicate thoughts which could previously only be verbalized. He furthers this argument by claiming that writing is purely context dependent as it is a \"secondary modelling system\" (8). Reliant upon the earlier primary system of spoken language, writing manipulates the potential of language as it depends purely upon the visual sense to communicate the intended information. Furthermore, the rather stagnant technology of literacy distinctly limits the usage and influence of knowledge, it unquestionably effects the evolution of society. In fact, Ong asserts that \"more than any other single invention, writing has transformed human consciousness\" (Ong 1982: 78).\n", "Media determinism is a form of technological determinism, a philosophical and sociological position which posits the power of the media to impact society.", " Two foundational media determinists are the Canadian scholars ", " and ", ". One of the best examples of technological determinism in media theory is Marshall McLuhan's theory \"", "\" and the ideas of his mentor Harold Adams Innis. Both these Canadian theorists saw media as the essence of civilization. The association of different media with particular mental consequences by McLuhan and others can be seen as related to technological determinism. It is this variety of determinism that is referred to as media determinism. According to McLuhan, there is an association between communications media/technology and language; similarly, ", " argues that language shapes our perception of thinking (", "). For McLuhan, media is a more powerful and explicit determinant than is the more general concept of language. McLuhan was not necessarily a hard determinist. As a more moderate version of media determinism, he proposed that our use of particular media may have subtle influences on us, but more importantly, it is the social context of use that is crucial.", " See also ", ".\nMedia determinism is a form of the popular dominant theory of the relationship between ", ". In a determinist view, technology takes on an active life of its own and is seen be as a driver of social phenomena. Innis believed that the social, cultural, political, and economic developments of each historical period can be related directly to the technology of the means of mass communication of that period. In this sense, like Dr. Frankenstein's monster, technology itself appears to be alive, or at least capable of shaping human behavior.", " However, it has been increasingly subject to critical review by scholars. For example, scholar ", ", criticizes media determinism and rather believes social movements define technological and media processes.", " With regard to communications media, audience determinism is a viewpoint opposed to media determinism. This is described as instead of media being presented as doing things to people; the stress is on the way people do things with media. Individuals need to be aware that the term \"deterministic\" is a negative one for many social scientists and modern sociologists; in particular they often use the word as a term of abuse.", "\n"]},

Convergence, simply put, is how individual consumers interact with others on a social level and use various media platforms to create new experiences, new forms of media and content that connect us socially, and not just to other consumers, but to the corporate producers of media in ways that have not been as readily accessible in the past. However, Lugmayr and Dal Zotto argued that media convergence takes place on the technology, content, consumer, business model, and management level.", " They argue that media convergence is a matter of evolution and can be described through the triadic phenomena of convergence, divergence, and coexistence.

If this revolutionary digital paradigm shift presumed that old media would be increasingly replaced by new media, the convergence paradigm that is currently emerging suggests that new and old media would interact in more complex ways than previously predicted. The paradigm shift that followed the digital revolution assumed that new media was going to change everything. When the dot-com market crashed, there was a tendency to imagine that nothing had changed. The real truth lay somewhere in between as there were so many aspects of the current media environment to take into consideration. Many industry leaders are increasingly reverting to media convergence as a way of making sense in an era of disorientating change. In that respect, media convergence in theory is essentially an old concept taking on a new meaning. Media convergence, in reality, is more than just a shift in technology. It alters relationships between industries, technologies, audiences, genres and markets. Media convergence changes the rationality media industries operate in, and the way that media consumers process news and entertainment. Media convergence is essentially a process and not an outcome, so no single black box controls the flow of media. With the proliferation of different media channels and increasing portability of new telecommunications and computing technologies, we have entered into an era where media constantly surrounds us.", "\n", "Media convergence requires that media companies rethink existing assumptions about media from the consumer's point of view, as these affect marketing and programming decisions. Media producers must respond to newly empowered consumers. Conversely, it would seem that hardware is instead diverging whilst media content is converging. Media has developed into brands that can offer content in a number of forms. Two examples of this are ", " and ", ". Both are films, but are also books, video games, cartoons, and action figures.

Hardware must be specific to each function. While most scholars argue that the flow of cross-media is accelerating,", " O'Donnell suggests, especially between films and video game, the semblance of media convergence is misunderstood by people outside of the media production industry. The conglomeration of media industry continues to sell the same story line in different media. For example, Batman is in comics, films, anime, and games. However, the data to create the image of batman in each media is created individually by different teams of creators. The same character and the same visual effect repetitively appear in different media is because of the synergy of media industry to make them similar as possible. In addition, convergence does not happen when the game of two different consoles is produced. No flows between two consoles because it is faster to create game from scratch for the industry.", "\n", "One of the more interesting new media journalism forms is virtual reality.

As discussed in ", " (by Campbell), convergence of technology is not new. It has been going on since the late 1920s. An example is RCA, the Radio Corporation of America, which purchased Victor Talking Machine Company and introduced machines that could receive radio and play recorded music. Next came the TV, and radio lost some of its appeal as people started watching television, which has both talking and music as well as visuals. As technology advances, convergence of media change to keep up. The second definition of media convergence Campbell discusses is cross-platform by media companies. This usually involves consolidating various media holdings, such as cable, phone, television (over the air, satellite, cable) and Internet access under one corporate umbrella. This is not for the consumer to have more media choices, this is for the benefit of the company to cut down on costs and maximize its profits.", " As stated in the article ", " by Mark Deuze, \"the convergence of production and consumption of media across companies, channels, genres, and technologies is an expression of the convergence of all aspects of everyday life: work and play, the local and the global, self and social identity.\"", "\n", "Communication networks were designed to carry different types of information independently. The older media, such as television and radio, are broadcasting networks with passive audiences. Convergence of telecommunication technology permits the manipulation of all forms of information, voice, data, and video.

Consequently, the possibility of audience interactivity morphs the passive audience into an engaged audience.", " The historical roots of convergence can be traced back to the emergence of ", " and the ", ", although the term properly applies only from the point in marketing history when fixed and mobile telephony began to be offered by operators as joined products.

In 1994, Knight Ridder promulgated the concept of portable magazines, newspaper, and books: \"Within news corporations it became increasingly obvious that an editorial model based on mere replication in the Internet of contents that had previously been written for print newspapers, radio, or television was no longer sufficient.\"", " The rise of digital communication in the late 20th century has made it possible for media organizations (or individuals) to deliver text, audio, and video material over the same wired, wireless, or fiber-optic connections. At the same time, it inspired some media organizations to explore multimedia delivery of information. This digital convergence of news media, in particular, was called \"Mediamorphosis\" by researcher Roger Fidler in his 1997 book by that name.", " Today, we are surrounded by a multi-level convergent media world where all modes of communication and information are continually reforming to adapt to the enduring demands of technologies, \"changing the way we create, consume, learn and interact with each other\".", "\n", " determines convergence culture to be the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of media audiences who will go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they want.

Besides marketing and entertainment, convergence culture has also affected the way we interact with news and information. We can access news on multiple levels of media from the radio, TV, newspapers, and the Internet. The Internet allows more people to be able to report the news through independent broadcasts and therefore allows a multitude of perspectives to be put forward and accessed by people in many different areas. Convergence allows news to be gathered on a much larger scale. For instance, photographs were taken of torture at ", ". These photos were shared and eventually posted on the Internet.

Star Wars fan films represent the intersection of two significant cultural trends—the corporate movement towards media convergence and the unleashing of significant new tools, which enable the grassroots archiving, annotation, appropriation, and recirculation of media content. These fan films build on long-standing practices of the fan community but they also reflect the influence of this changed technological environment that has dramatically lowered the costs of film production and distribution.", "Some media observers expect that we will eventually access all media content through one device, or \"black box\".", " As such, media business practice has been to identify the next \"black box\" to invest in and provide media for. This has caused a number of problems. Firstly, as \"black boxes\" are invented and abandoned, the individual is left with numerous devices that can perform the same task, rather than one dedicated for each task. For example, one may own both a computer and a video games console, subsequently owning two DVD players. This is contrary to the streamlined goal of the \"black box\" theory, and instead creates clutter.", " Secondly, technological convergence tends to be experimental in nature. This has led to consumers owning technologies with additional functions that are harder, if not impractical, to use rather than one specific device. Many people would only watch the TV for the duration of the meal's cooking time, or whilst in the kitchen, but would not use the microwave as the household TV. These examples show that in many cases technological convergence is unnecessary or unneeded.\n", "Furthermore, although consumers primarily use a specialized media device for their needs, other \"black box\" devices that perform the same task can be used to suit their current situation. As a 2002 Cheskin Research report explained: \"...Your email needs and expectations are different whether you're at home, work, school, commuting, the airport, etc., and these different devices are designed to suit your needs for accessing content depending on where you are- your situated context.\" Despite the creation of \"black boxes\", intended to perform all tasks, the trend is to use devices that can suit the consumer's physical position.", " Due to the variable utility of portable technology, convergence occurs in high-end mobile devices. They incorporate multimedia services, GPS, Internet access, and mobile telephony into a single device, heralding the rise of what has been termed the \"smartphone,\" a device designed to remove the need to carry multiple devices. Convergence of media occurs when multiple products come together to form one product with the advantages of all of them, also known as the black box. This idea of one technology, concocted by ", ", has become known more as a fallacy because of the inability to actually put all technical pieces into one. For example, while people can have email and Internet on their phone, they still want full computers with Internet and email in addition. Mobile phones are a good example, in that they incorporate ", ", MP3 players, ", ", and other devices. For the consumer, it means more features in less space; for ", " it means remaining competitive.\n", "However, convergence has a downside. Particularly in initial forms, converged devices are frequently less functional and reliable than their component parts (e.g., a mobile phone's web browser may not render some web pages correctly, due to not supporting certain rendering methods, such as the ", " browser not supporting ", " content). As the number of functions in a single device escalates, the ability of that device to serve its original function decreases.", " As Rheingold asserts, technological convergence holds immense potential for the \"improvement of life and liberty in some ways and (could) degrade it in others\".", " He believes the same technology has the potential to be \"used as both a weapon of social control and a means of resistance\".", " Since technology has evolved in the past ten years or so, companies are beginning to converge technologies to create demand for new products.

One example of this can be seen in She-Ra's and He-Man's transformation sequences.\n", "This frequent use of stock footage saved production money, but often resulted in sacrifice of continuity. This was countered by cutting from one stock shot to another after only a second or two, long enough to set the scene but before the eye could notice all of the unexplained errors. This became part of the Filmation style during a period when most television and motion picture productions tended to run minimum shots of 4–5 seconds.\n", "In contrast to the rapid ", " during action sequences, another Filmation trademark was the recurring use of long establishing shots in which the camera would pan slowly across a very wide background painting, thus filling up ", " with sequences requiring little or no animation. Filmation also pioneered other animation technologies, particularly in ", ", which included backlighting effects for the first time in American animation (they were already in use in Japan), including ", " effects to represent energy fields (a technique that was later used in ", " and in ", "). It also pioneered a unique method of generating 3-D vehicle animation by filming white-outlined black miniatures against black backgrounds using a computerized motion-control camera and high-contrast film, then printing the negatives onto acetate frame-by-frame, to create animation cels which were then hand-painted. This produced a three-dimensional effect that had been used by Disney in films such as ", " previously. It predated the modern use of 3-D ", " for vehicles in 2-D animated productions. However, it had a distinctive \"flicker\" to it, because some of the painted lines went in and out of visibility as the miniatures moved.\n", "Unlike many American studios, Filmation never relied on animation studios outside the United States for the bulk of its production; ", " and ", " both state in the ending credits that they were \"made entirely in the U.S.A.\" This occurred during a time when rival studio Hanna-Barbera shifted from saying in the final production credits (immediately before the production logo appearances) \"A Hanna-Barbera Production\" to \"Produced in Association with: ", " / Cuckoo's Nest Studios\" which is located in ", " (along with H-B's own ", "-based Fil-Cartoons). The quality of Filmation's \"Made Entirely in the U.S.A.\" strategy was comparable to the outsourced animation.

Many of the sound effects used in its cartoons are also very familiar, the majority of them being recycled from Hanna-Barbera (this was, and still is, a common trait among animation companies, though Filmation's copies of the Hanna-Barbera sound effects were of a distinctively lower quality), though the company's ", " cartoons of 1966–67 used more realistic sound effects.\n", "Filmation received particular criticism for ", ", an animated continuation of the long-running live-action series ", ".

As a result, many of Entertainment Rights' DVD releases (distributed by BCI Eclipse LLC in the United States prior to the latter company's folding) were based on the international versions (which have PAL prints).\n", "Because they were taken from PAL-based transfers, without correction, these releases exhibit the so-called ", " in which the soundtrack plays 4% too fast, which results in the pitch being a half-step higher than it was originally (see ", " and ", " for more information).
